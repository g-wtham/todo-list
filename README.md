# Todo List

A To-do list project, to store your task temporarily, yeah, your to-do list is gone once you hit that nice little REFRESH button on your browser!

A Beginner's Flex project to showcase his javascript skills, which ain't called skills though, I guess, just some basic stuff hiding inside!

As a beginner, I learned the following javascript concepts while doing this tiny project :

- Select and interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Attaching event listeners to elements.
- Use if statements to perform actions based on certain conditions.
- Dynamically create new HTML elements and add them to the DOM.
- Add CSS classes and IDs to elements to target and style promptly.

  Took minutes to summarize, but hours to complete the project, as the js concepts weren't kicking into my brain properly - BEGINNER RANTS :)

NotSoFun Fact: Just don't look at my CSS file! It's crying in corner...
